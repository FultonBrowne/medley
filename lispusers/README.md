# LispUsers packages for Medley

These were contributed by people from Xerox and also from Medley and earlier customers, for distribution with sources and an implicit license for creation of derivative works; this is in the days before "Open Source" was a thing.

Some of these are included in full.sysout; some migrated between library and lispusers over time.

In order to tidy the lispusers directory, some files have been moved:

Previous enumerations of released "lispusers" packages and instructions have (temporarily) been moved to docs/lispusers.

Some files have been moved to obsolete/lispusers.
